what quickMeshBeta do for the moment ?

load a image file at the beginning

add point by -clicking-
remove them with -right-clic-
drag them

make or remake a delaunay triangulation with -f-, and then :
rollover the triangle center,
delete triangle face with -d-   !!!! remove then 1 by 1 !!!!
add triangle face with -a-

save the mesh with -s-
load the vertex of a *.obj with -l-
erase with -e-



don't know why, but the texture Y-coords need +1 with octaneExporter,
so i've add a +1 button in max in the mesh viewport window ...
